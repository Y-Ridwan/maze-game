# Maze Game

## Introduction
Maze Game is not just another simple grid-based game—it's the product of my curiosity about pathfinding algorithms and my passion for creating interactive projects that challenge the player. Developed during my time at [Holberton School], this project combines basic game development with algorithmic thinking to create a fun, yet mentally stimulating game. 

Navigating through the maze isn’t just about pressing the arrow keys—it’s about understanding grid-based movement, edge detection, and spatial constraints. Inspired by the classic mazes I loved solving as a child, I wanted to recreate that excitement, but with a digital twist.

You can play the game [here](#) or check out the live demo.

## Technical Details
At its core, the Maze Game is a browser-based grid navigation game. But beneath that simplicity lies a deep attention to detail and thoughtful decision-making. 

### Key Concepts:
- **Grid-based movement**: The maze is built on a 5x5 grid, with each cell representing either an empty space, a blocked cell (obstacle), or a player/destination.
- **Collision detection**: One of the challenges was ensuring the player can’t move through walls. I handled this by storing the blocked cells as coordinates in an array and using JavaScript’s `find()` function to check for collisions before updating the player's position.
- **Event Handling**: Movement is controlled via arrow key inputs. I implemented event listeners that detect key presses and update the player's position accordingly. If a blocked cell is detected, the move is invalidated and the player’s position remains unchanged.
  
### Code Breakdown
Here’s a brief breakdown of some of the key code elements:

1. **Grid Creation**:
   The grid is dynamically generated using JavaScript, and each cell is assigned an ID for easy access when moving the player.
   ```javascript
   for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       var row = document.createElement('tr');
       for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
           var cell = document.createElement('td');
           cell.id = `${i}-${j}`;
           if (blocked.find(block => block.x === j && block.y === i)) {
               cell.className = 'blocked';
           }
           row.appendChild(cell);
       }
       maze.appendChild(row);
   }
   ```

2. **Player Movement**:
   Key press events trigger the movement of the player. Before moving, we check if the new position is a blocked cell:
   ```javascript
   function handleKeydown(event) {
       var oldPosition = { x: playerPosition.x, y: playerPosition.y };

       switch(event.key) {
           case 'ArrowUp':
               playerPosition.y = Math.max(playerPosition.y - 1, 0);
               break;
           case 'ArrowDown':
               playerPosition.y = Math.min(playerPosition.y + 1, 4);
               break;
           case 'ArrowLeft':
               playerPosition.x = Math.max(playerPosition.x - 1, 0);
               break;
           case 'ArrowRight':
               playerPosition.x = Math.min(playerPosition.x + 1, 4);
               break;
       }

       if (blocked.find(block => block.x === playerPosition.x && block.y === playerPosition.y)) {
           playerPosition = oldPosition; // Block movement if it's a wall
       } else {
           document.getElementById(`${oldPosition.y}-${oldPosition.x}`).classList.remove('player');
           document.getElementById(`${playerPosition.y}-${playerPosition.x}`).className += ' player';
       }

       if (playerPosition.y === 4 && playerPosition.x === 4) {
           setTimeout(function() { alert('Congratulations, you reached the target!'); }, 100);
       }
   }
   ```

## My Journey & Challenges

I started this project with a basic understanding of grids, but I wanted to challenge myself to create a fully interactive game. It wasn’t easy! One of the biggest hurdles was managing the player’s collision with blocked cells—ensuring smooth movement while preventing the player from walking through walls.

Another challenge was keeping the game responsive. I wanted the design to be intuitive and visually appealing, whether it’s played on a large desktop screen or a smaller mobile device. Achieving this meant writing clean, flexible CSS and carefully testing the user interface on different screen sizes.

I also learned a lot about **event-driven programming** while working on this game. Handling user input in real-time (like key presses) and ensuring the game state updates accordingly was a fun, yet complex, aspect of the project.

### What’s Next?
In the next iteration, I’d love to add some more advanced features:
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like A* to show the optimal path to the destination.
- **Level Progression**: Creating multiple levels with increasing difficulty and different grid sizes.
- **AI Opponent**: Introducing an AI-controlled opponent that tries to reach the destination before the player.

## Installation

To play the game locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithubprofile/maze-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd maze-game
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage

Use the arrow keys to navigate the red player through the maze to reach the green destination. Watch out for the black blocked cells! If you reach the destination, you’ll get a congratulatory message.

### Controls:
- **Arrow Up**: Move up
- **Arrow Down**: Move down
- **Arrow Left**: Move left
- **Arrow Right**: Move right

### Winning Condition:
- The player wins when they reach the destination at the bottom-right corner of the grid.
